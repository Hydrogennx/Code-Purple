# FirstJump
A two-player strategic bullet hell game for the BPA competition.

## TODO (Action Phase / General):
 * Fix character movement to be consistent
 * Change the hitbox for the player to be a diamond, and closer more accurate for the bullets
 * Implement multiple attacks via button
 * Create graphics for attacks and their bullets
 * Turn the buttons into ImageButtons
 * Begin HotseatInstance and/or HostInstance / ClientInstance

## TODO (Turn Phase):
 * Run strategic half of the game by everyone
 * Create Purple bars for Primary and Bonus
 * Prevent using certain attacks if Purple is low enough
 * Create 3 groups of 4 moves rather than a giant list of options
 * Add passive effects
 * Add multi-attacks
 * Allow players at some point to build decks
