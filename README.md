# com.hydrogennx.SwingGameManager
A two-player strategic bullet hell game for the BPA competition.

## TODO:
 * Allow the character to move
 * Detect if the character collides with bullets
 * Register damage based on these collisions rather than decreasing over time
 * Go back to the TurnPhase when the round is finished, one way or another
 * Go to the EndPhase when the player is eliminated
 * Implement multiple attacks via button
 * Create graphics for attacks and their bullets
 * Turn the buttons into ImageButtons
 * Save health across ActionPhases (or at all)
 * Begin HotseatInstance and/or HostInstance / ClientInstance

 * Run strategic half of the game by everyone
 * Create Purple bars for Primary and Bonus
 * Prevent using certain attacks if Purple is low enough
 * Create 3 groups of 4 moves rather than a giant list of options
 * Add passive effects
 * Add multi-attacks
 * Allow players at some point to build decks
